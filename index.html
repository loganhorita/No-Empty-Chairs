    <h2>Welcome</h2>

        <p>
            Several years ago, my parents made more of an effort to have dinner together as a family. 
            Gone were the days of eating when we felt like taking a break from homework or whenever it was most convenient for us. 
            At dinner time, the expectation was that — if everyone were home — each of those six chairs would have a person in it. 
            When someone was not yet home but would return within the next few minutes, we would wait. 
            However, occasionally, Dad was busy with a client, Hyrum’s football practice ran late, Asia and Ellie were sleeping over at a friend’s house, 
            or I was working on something at school, and one or two chairs were empty at family dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
            One evening, my siblings and I were a little late to the dinner table. We were likely preoccupied; on the phone with friends, doing homework, studying for tests, or playing video games. Once we were all seated, my parents explained why they felt this meal needed to be shared. “This meal,” my dad said, “that we have together is to be a reminder of the standard in this family: in heaven, there are to be no empty chairs.”
        </p>

        <p>
            I have thought about this “no empty chairs” often in my life, and the dual responsibility conveyed by this phrase to both (1) ensure I sit in my chair in Heaven and (2) invite and help others, especially those whom I love, to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up in the youth program, I could never escape my dad. With each of my advancements in the priesthood, my dad would receive a new calling. I became a Deacon, and Dad became the Deacon’s Quorum Advisor. I became a Teacher, and Dad became the Teacher’s Quorum Advisor. I became a Priest, and Dad became Bishop. Sure enough, as I prepared to be ordained an Elder, Dad was called to the Stake Presidency, and my Melchizedek Priesthood interview was with President Joshua Horita.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the many benefits of having the same youth leader for so many years is the consistency with which my father reminded me of that first responsibility — sitting in that chair prepared for me in Heaven. Following the usual opening prayer, announcements, and recitation of the Aaronic priesthood theme conducted every quorum meeting, Dad would turn to face the young man nearest him and ask, “Whose responsibility is it to make sure you return to Heavenly Father?” The young man would then respond with, “My own.” Dad would then turn to the next quorum member, ask that very same question, receive the same response, and continue until every person in attendance vocally reaffirmed their individual responsibility to return to the presence of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ. “Wherefore, [we] are free,” and because we are free, the responsibility rests on each of us, individually, “to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men” (2 Nephi 2:27).
        </p>
        <p>
            The part that scares me about that previous phrase — no empty chairs — is not so much that I might not be there. I am determined to be. I have set my mind to it. I have 100% control over whether I make it there. As my dad so frequently reminded me, it is, after all, my own responsibility. No, the part that frightens me, that keeps me up at night, is my inability to control whether my brother will be there, my sisters, or even my parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well then,” you might think, “what’s the point? Why have you and thousands of other young men and women served missions? Why have the Brethren in Salt Lake counseled that we take on ministering in a higher and holier way? Why do I drag my children to Sacrament meetings or youth activities or have a spray bottle on hand for the moment my husband closes his eyes during General Conference? If it’s ultimately their decision to sit in their chair, why do I do this, and you do that? Does what I do really matter?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer is an unequivocal “yes, it most certainly does matter.” Though I may not be able to force those I love to receive a gift that he or she does not want, I believe there is much I can do, much I should do, that they might desire this said gift. I can wrap it and make it pretty. Put a nice bow and a sticker with his or her name on it. Most importantly, I can testify how that gift has blessed my life. I can still invite them to open it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sister Bonnie H. Cordon taught a simple principle. “Come unto Christ,” she said, “Come now, but don’t come alone.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Interestingly, we cannot honestly invite others to come unto Christ if we are not willing or working to do the same. Christ made clear that those who preached that which they would not follow have no place at His table in heaven. “Woe unto you, [...] hypocrites,” Christ rebuked, “for ye are like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness” (Matthew 23:27).
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, no person sitting in their chair in heaven would ever arrive having not invited others to join them. The prophet Alma, having experienced “exceeding great joy,” writes, “...I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste [that] which I did taste” (Alma 36:24). If we, too, like Alma, taste of that joy, the natural result is our unceasing labor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, no person truly converted to Christ would ever selfishly withhold the joy he’s come to know through Him. Or allow fear of rejection and retribution to overpower love for his Father and concern for his Father’s children. We will not sit in our chairs in Heaven and come unto Christ without inviting and helping others to do the same. It is simply not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, just for a second, never mind that our inheriting that throne in the heavens is intrinsically connected to our commitment to share this message with others. Never mind that the second great commandment is to “love thy neighbor as thyself” (Matthew 22:39). Never mind that we covenant at baptism to “mourn with those that mourn” and “comfort those that stand in need of comfort” (Mosiah 18:9). Never mind that the Lord says, “If any...among you be strong in the Spirit, let [them] take with [them those] that [are] weak, that [the weak] may be edified in all meekness, that [they] may become strong also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:106). Disregard all that and picture that empty chair where Mom, Dad, sibling, and child should be sitting but are not.
        </p>
        <p>
            That feeling of immense responsibility, urgency, deep love, and maybe even worry, which perhaps you feel now, I have learned to call “charity” — of which the Lord says, “If ye have not…ye are nothing” (Moroni 7:46). It is with this charity that I prepare this record — a collection of stories from many but as if “the voice of one crying [even] from the dust” (2 Nephi 22:13). These stories come from they who walk the road of discipleship, the road to eternal life — they whose greatest desire is that of no empty chairs.
