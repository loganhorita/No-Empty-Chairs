            <h2>Logan Horita</h2>
            <p>
                Logan M.M. Horita is the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of <em>No Empty Chairs</em>, a blog dedicated to fostering faith-centered reflections and encouraging intentional choices in media and life. Rooted in his deep love for the gospel and family, Logan created <em>No Empty Chairs</em> to help others navigate their spiritual journey while keeping their focus on what matters most: their faith, relationships, and eternal perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Loganâ€™s commitment to service began as a full-time missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Japan Nagoya Mission and the California Oakland/San Francisco Mission. There, he learned to love sharing the gospel, strengthening communities, and deepening his understanding of God. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In July 2023, Logan married his best friend, Sefia, in the Laie Hawaii Temple, a sacred beginning to their eternal family. Together, they look forward to welcoming their first child in April 2024, a new chapter that fills their hearts with gratitude and anticipation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through <em>No Empty Chairs</em>, Logan shares reflections on faith, family, and media that align with gospel principles, inviting others to make choices that bring lasting joy and strengthen their connection to God. Whether through the written word or quiet moments with loved ones, Logan believes in the importance of ensuring that no one is left behind and no chair is left empty.
            </p>
